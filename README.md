# GIMI – OpenProject Synchronizer

A Python-based integration tool designed to synchronize project data between [GIMI](https://www.futuraservice.com/gimi-.net.html) 
— a proprietary management software — 
and [OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org/), an open-source project management platform.

This tool enables companies using GIMI to benefit from the advanced and structured project management capabilities of OpenProject by keeping both systems aligned automatically.

## Overview

GIMI–OpenProject Synchronizer connects to both systems and ensures that all projects registered in the GIMI database are also created and updated in OpenProject.

While GIMI provides essential business management functionalities, OpenProject offers powerful features such as task tracking, Gantt charts, work packages, and team collaboration tools.
This integration bridges the gap, combining GIMI’s management backbone with OpenProject’s advanced project control environment.

Currently in **developing** phase.
